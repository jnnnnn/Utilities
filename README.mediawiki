= A collection of utility programs =

== projecteuler ==

No answers to the problems themselves, but some things that are useful for many of the problems.

== treasurehunt ==

A small template for making treasure hunts!

A treasure hunt of this style goes like this:
# The user finds a clue somewhere in the real world, with a link.
# The link takes them to the first html page of the hunt, that has a riddle on it!
#* They solve the riddle, type in the answer, and get a clue for an object in the real world
# They go find the next real-world item, with comes with another link...

A decent collection of error messages is included for wrong answers.

== baseconv ==

A single html page that allows the user to convert between any (positive) base with arbitrary precision and pretty good performance.

== wordmaker trigram ==

This utility generates random nonsensical words based on a large input file.

Project Gutenberg provides excellent source material.
